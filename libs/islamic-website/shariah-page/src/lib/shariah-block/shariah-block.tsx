          Integrating the Shariah Oracle with HAQQ Wallet will ensure that users
          interact only with whitelisted, Sharia-compliant dApps. Thus whilst
          being a place where anyone can deploy their dApp or project, HAQQ
          networkâ€™s Shariah Oracle is a key measure to minimize unethical or
          Haram activity in our network.
